Meeting Oct 23, 2019

1. I wrote a code chunk; it's better if we name our dataset the same way, to uniform things. we can put our code on
that chunk.  

2. for each dataset, the first column 'id' stands for each dwelling unit, it could be the key to combine all the dataset.

3. for step I, we are asked to show descriptive statistics for relevant and important variables. 
 
Here is a list of all variables from 5 dataset that I think are important. please add more if you feel something are left out.
once we have decided, we can make some statistics.

[price, adjusted_price, minimum_nights, maximum_nights, date, number_of_reviews, location variable like lingitute, ]
 
Lots of entities are strings not numerical. we need to figure how to deal with that.
